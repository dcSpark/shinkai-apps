The tool should accept configuration parameters including an optional API key, and input parameters for pagination (page, page_size), sorting options (by market cap, volume, or ID in ascending or descending order), filtering by volume and market cap ranges, and currency denomination. Implement robust error handling with retry logic using the tenacity library, handle rate limiting appropriately, and include fallback mock data for testing purposes. The tool should return a structured output containing formatted coin data (including ID, symbol, name, current price, market cap, volume, and 24-hour price change) along with pagination details. Ensure the implementation follows type hints, includes proper API status checking, and formats the response data consistently.',
